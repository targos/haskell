# Higher order functions

Notes from <https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/higher-order-functions.html>.

## Curried functions

* All functions only have one "real" parameter.
* When we pass less than the expected number of parameters, we get a partially applied function in return.
* Infix functions can be partially applied.
